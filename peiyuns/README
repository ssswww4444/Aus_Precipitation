    Detailed Description:
    
    * This data set is part of products suite from the CPC Unified
    Precipitation Project that are underway at NOAA Climate Prediction
    Center (CPC). The primary goal of the project is to create a suite
    of unified precipitation products with consistent quantity and
    improved quality by combining all information sources available at
    CPC and by taking advantage of the optimal interpolation (OI)
    objective analysis technique. See their CPC's data docs for more
    details.
    Values are acculated for a day but that day can be at different
    times for different locations. See the documentation.
    
    Caveats:
    
    * Real-time values change change before N days.

    /Datasets/cpc_global_precip/)
    * precip.time.statistic.nc for daily long term means  (In directory:
    /Datasets/cpc_global_precip/)
    
    Dataset Format and Size:
    * PSL standard NetCDF about 65 Mbyte netCDF4 file for each yearly
    file.

    * Please note: If you acquire CPC Global Unified Precipitation data
    products from PSL, we ask that you acknowledge us in your use of
    the data. This may be done by including text such as CPC Global
    Unified Precipitation data provided by the NOAA/OAR/ESRL PSL,
    Boulder, Colorado, USA, from their Web site at
    https://psl.noaa.gov/ in any documents or publications
    using these data. We would also appreciate receiving a copy of the
    relevant publications. This will help PSL to justify keeping the
    CPC Global Unified Precipitation data set freely available online
    in the future. Thank you!
